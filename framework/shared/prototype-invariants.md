# Prototype Invariants

Behavioural invariants that hold for every prototype produced by this framework. Appended verbatim to the end of every merged `requirements/requirements.md` by the requirements-merger. Read by designers and prototype builders to understand what the requirements assume the prototype is and is not.

Add new invariants by appending; do not renumber.

## PI-01 — Server behaviour is simulated

All server-side behaviour — authentication, API calls, database operations, third-party integrations, scheduled jobs — is simulated by client-side stubs. Backend-shaped requirements describe the user-visible behaviour the simulation must reproduce, not real implementation. Endpoints, middleware, message queues, and infrastructure are out of scope.

## PI-02 — Data is fixture-backed

All data displayed in the prototype is sourced from in-memory fixtures shipped with the build. Mutations persist within a session but do not survive a reload unless an explicit "demo data" mode is specified. There is no real database, no migrations, and no data import / export pipelines.

## PI-03 — Validation is visual only

Form-field validation messages and inline error feedback are rendered as specified by the requirements, but no server-side enforcement is exercised. Constraints that are not visible in the UI — uniqueness checks, referential integrity, rate limiting, idempotency — are not run, even when the requirements name them.

## PI-04 — Third-party integrations are visual

Email, SMS, payment, mapping, file storage, and analytics integrations appear in the UI as visual confirmations or placeholder content. No external network calls are made. Where the requirements describe a third-party flow, the prototype reproduces the user-visible steps and the resulting UI state, not the network exchange.

## PI-05 — Role switcher

Every screen accessible to more than one role displays a role switcher in the prototype's surrounding chrome — outside the application UI under design — so reviewers can inspect each role's view without re-authenticating. The switcher is clearly labelled as a prototype tool, not an in-app control, and is placed in the same position on every screen. It lists every role defined in §3 of the requirements; roles to whom the active screen is not accessible per §6.5 RBAC are rendered in a disabled state. Switching the active role must immediately update the screen's visible components and actions to match the rules captured in the requirements (RBAC entries, conditional visibility, role-gated actions).
